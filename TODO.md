# TODO

## First

- Change from random a new team at the start of next game to switch team

## Next

- Coin skins
- Money to buy skins
- Find a way to have the `s` state back in the `module` script tag so that it's not "loading" every time coming back to the game page
- Refactor `lib.rs`

## Later

- Leaderboard: 6 months, all time
- Show warning modal when a player is about to leave but still in game
- Add new chat item: player joined/left the room
- Add the ability to select how many columns to play with
- Game history: show the last 10 games played, and the ability to replay them
  - Store moves in the game table (best if replace `table` field with this field, though check win logic will be changed completely)
- Invite feature: when in a room, you can invite outside players to join the room
- Message TTL: messages self-delete after a certain time
- Advanced SEO: add meta tags for social media sharing
- Message rate limit on the frontend
- Attempt to reconnect if connection is lost
- Keyboard mode:
